# Agentic RAG Pipeline with LangChain | Multi-Tool Reasoning using LLMs

📂 **Skills Highlighted:** LangChain Agents · Tool Integration · Prompt Engineering · NLP · Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) · LLMs

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This project showcases an **agentic workflow** built using **LangChain agents** that intelligently combine multiple tools to answer complex user queries. The system dynamically decides which tools to invoke — such as retrievers, calculators, or document readers — and orchestrates them to generate accurate and context-aware responses.

Built with a focus on **multi-step reasoning**, this agent pipeline simulates real-world decision-making and demonstrates how language models can autonomously choose the right operations to fulfill user requests.

## 🧪 Example Use Case

```markdown
**User Query:**  
"What's the average temperature in Delhi over the last week, and how does it compare to Mumbai?"

**Agent Flow:**  
1. Uses a search tool to fetch weather data  
2. Uses calculator tool to compute averages  
3. Compares both and returns a natural language summary  
```
